      <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
      <p>Throughout this program, I transitioned from writing functional assignments to building structured, secure, and maintainable software systems. The capstone forced me to stop thinking in terms of “does it work?” and start thinking in terms of architecture, scalability, validation, security, and long-term maintainability.</p>
      <p>Developing this ePortfolio required me to present my work not as coursework, but as documented evidence of technical ability. I now approach development the way industry expects: with intentional design decisions, documented trade-offs, and clear technical communication.</p>
      <p>My goal as a software engineer is to build systems that are reliable, secure, and thoughtfully designed, not just functional.</p>
      
      <h3>Collaboration and Communication</h3>
      <p>Engineering is not a solo activity. Throughout the program, I participated in peer reviews, structured feedback cycles, and technical discussions that required me to defend design decisions and evaluate alternative approaches.</p>
      <p>In my recorded code review and written enhancement narratives, I practiced explaining complex technical concepts clearly to an academic audience, similar to communicating system behavior to stakeholders or team members.</p>
      <p>Outside of this capstone, my experience in the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA) reinforced working through development milestones under real constraints, presenting technical decisions clearly, and maintaining consistent documentation and structure.</p>
      <p>I learned that clean architecture, naming conventions, and readable code are not preferences, they are collaboration tools.</p>

      <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
      <p>My coursework strengthened my ability to design solutions using algorithmic reasoning rather than guesswork.</p>
      <p>Instead of relying on built-in methods without thought, I evaluated time complexity, ordering, and efficiency. Implementing sorting logic, rolling averages, and trend detection required careful attention to performance and correctness.</p>
      <p>I now approach problems by selecting appropriate data structures, analyzing trade-offs, and considering scalability from the start. That mindset is foundational to professional engineering.</p>

      <h3>Software Engineering and Databases</h3>
      <p>Across this program, I worked with layered architecture, MVC design patterns, relational schema design, validation frameworks, and database integration.</p>
      <p>Refactoring a console application into a structured ASP.NET Core MVC web application reinforced separation of concerns and maintainability. Integrating relational databases required careful schema design, controlled data persistence, and secure user-specific data handling.</p>
      <p>I developed hands-on experience with Entity Framework Core, SQLite, structured queries, model-level validation, and controlled data access. These are practical, production-relevant skills, not just academic exercises.</p>

      <h3>Security Mindset</h3>
      <p>Security became a recurring theme across multiple courses. I learned to anticipate vulnerabilities such as hardcoded credentials, insufficient validation, injection risks, and weak authentication practices.</p>
      <p>By implementing structured validation, secure database access patterns, and authentication mechanisms, I developed a proactive security mindset. Security is not an afterthought in my design process; it is part of the architecture from the start.</p>

      <h3>How the Artifacts Work Together</h3>
      <p>The artifacts in this portfolio demonstrate growth across core computer science domains.</p>
      <p>The <b>Mortgage Calculator</b> shows my progression in software engineering and database integration, from console-based logic to structured web architecture with persistent storage and validation.</p>
      <p>The <b>Weight Tracker Android application</b> demonstrates algorithm-driven problem solving within a mobile environment. By introducing rolling averages, sorting logic, and trend detection, I transformed simple CRUD functionality into meaningful data analysis.</p>
      <p>Together, these projects demonstrate structured software design, algorithmic reasoning, database integration, security awareness, and professional communication.</p>
      <p>This portfolio represents not just completed coursework, but documented proof of my ability to design, build, analyze, and communicate software solutions aligned with industry expectations.</p>

    <h2>Enhancement 1: Software Design & Engineering</h2>

    <p class="enhancement-summary">
      This enhancement focuses on refactoring a console-based mortgage calculator into
      a structured ASP.NET Core MVC web application. The goal was to improve
      maintainability, separation of concerns, validation, and alignment with
      professional software engineering practices.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Improvements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Refactored application from console-based C# to ASP.NET Core MVC</li>
      <li>Introduced layered architecture and separation of concerns</li>
      <li>Implemented model-level input validation</li>
      <li>Improved user flow and overall usability</li>

    <h2>Enhancement 2: Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>

    <p class="enhancement-summary">
      In this enhancement I extended the Android Weight Tracker application beyond simple data storage by introducing structured data handling and algorithmic analysis. Weight entries are now stored as structured objects and processed using algorithmic logic to generate insights such as rolling averages and trend indicators, allowing the application to present calculated insights rather than raw values alone.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Improvements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Refactored database queries to return structured collections</li>
      <li>Applied sorting logic to ensure consistent chronological ordering prior to analysis</li>
      <li>Designed a rolling average algorithm to smooth short-term fluctuations</li>
      <li>Implemented trend detection logic based on changes in rolling averages </li>

    <h2>Enhancement 3: Databases</h2>

    <p class="enhancement-summary">
      This enhancement extended the Mortgage Calculator from a stateless calculation tool into a data-driven web application by introducing relational database integration and persistent storage. Users can now save, retrieve, and manage calculation history tied to authenticated accounts.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Improvements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Integrated Entity Framework Core for relational data persistence</li>
      <li>Associated saved calculations with individual authenticated users</li>
      <li>Developed secure retrieval and history viewing functionality</li>
